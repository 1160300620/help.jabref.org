# The help window

*Opened by clicking the help button or pressing F1.*

The help window is there to provide information about using JabRef.

## Navigating the help files

The help window is in fact a lightweight HTML browser, and the help files are standard HTML files.

When opened, the help window will default to different files depending on which program window it is called from. If this file doesn't explain the aspect you are interested in, the *Contents* button in the toolbar will take you to a list of the available help files.

In addition the toolbar contains navigation buttons for showing the next or previous file. These are similar to the *Back* and *Forward* buttons of a standard web browser. The keyboard shortcuts for navigation are the arrow key left for *Back* and the arrow key right for *Forward*.

The help window is closed by pressing ESCAPE.
