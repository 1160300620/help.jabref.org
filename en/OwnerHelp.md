# The 'owner' field

JabRef can optionally mark all new entries added or imported to a database with your username. You can disable or enable this feature by entering **Preferences -&gt; General**, and you can also change the name used to mark your entries. The default name used is your user name.

The name will be added in a field called 'owner', which by default is visible in the **General fields** tab in the Entry Editor.
