# Creating entries using an ISBN number

To use this feature, choose **BibTeX -&gt; New entry...**.
In the lower part, there is the box "ID-based entry generator".
In the field "ID type", "ISBN" should be already selected.
The field "ID" is focused.
Enter the ISBN here and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to generate an entry based on the Id.
You can also click on "Generate".
Then, [eBook.de's](http://www.ebook.de/) API is used to convert an ISBN to a BibTeX entry.
The found entry is opened in an entry editor.
In case an error occurs, a popup is shown.

The JabRef team is aware that not all valid ISBNs lead to an entry being generated by this generator.
See <https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2238> for a discussion of alternatives.
