# Search Google Scholar

JabRef can search and download citations from Google Scholar. To use this feature, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **Google Scholar** in the dropdown menu.

To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press **Enter** or the **Fetch** button.

Frequent connections to Google Scholar will cause Google to display a CAPTCHA challenge which JabRef cannot pass. To avoid this, JabRef will for each search display a preview of the first page of entries returned by the server. You can then choose which entries to download.
