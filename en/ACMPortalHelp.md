Search ACM Portal
=================

The ACM Portal includes two databases: the ACM Digital Library that is a full text collection of every article published by ACM, including over 50 years of archives, and the Guide to Computing Literature that is a bibliographic collection from major publishers in computing with over one million entries.

JabRef can download citations from the ACM Portal database. To use this feature, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **ACM Portal** in the dropdown menu.

To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press **Enter** or the **Fetch** button.

You may choose which database to search and you may opt to download the abstracts along with the cite information for each entry, by checking the **Include abstracts** checkbox.

Frequent connections to ACM Portal may get your IP banned for hours. To avoid this, JabRef will for each search display a preview of the first page of entries returned by the server. You can then choose which entries to download.

Please email Aaron Chen **nextAaron@gmail.com** for any suggestions.
