JStor search
============

To use this feature, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **JStor** in the dropdown menu. The JStor search relies on the BibSonomy scraper project (http://scraper.bibsonomy.org/) to extract information from the JStor web page.

The following help was taken from the JStor website and may change if JStor does:

-   You will be searching the author, title, and full-text of all types of journal content (articles, book reviews, etc.) by default
-   Use quotation marks to search for a phrase (e.g., "punctuated equilibrium")
-   Use ti: to search for an article title, au: to search for an author (e.g., ti:"two-person cooperative games", au:"john nash")
-   Use AND, OR, NOT to combine terms (e.g., ti:"two-person cooperative games" AND au:"john nash")

JStor is a not-for-profit organization with a dual mission to create and maintain a trusted archive of important scholarly journals, and to provide access to these journals as widely as possible. JSTOR offers researchers the ability to retrieve high-resolution, scanned images of journal issues and pages as they were originally designed, printed, and illustrated. The journals archived in JSTOR span many disciplines.

JStor offers access to the following topics:

-   art & sciences
-   biology
-   business
-   ecology & botany
-   health & general sciences
-   languages & literature
-   mathematics & statistics
-   music

You will be prompted with the number of entries found, and given a choice of how many to download. The search provides a maximum of 200 results (8 pages of 25 hits) to limit the burden.
