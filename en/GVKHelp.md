# Search the GVK (Common Union Catalogue)

The GVK search capability can be used to query the [GVK](http://www.gbv.de/) (Common Union Catalogue) and automatically import references into JabRef.

To use this feature, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **GVKFetcher** in the dropdown menu.

You can simply enter words / names / years you want to search for, or you can specify search keys.

Supported keywords are

-   all - all words. Not specifing a search key results in an "all" search
-   tit - title words
-   per - authors, editors, etc.
-   thm - topics
-   slw - key words
-   txt - tables of content
-   num - numbers, e.g. ISBN
-   kon - names of conferences
-   ppn - Pica Production Numbers of the GVK
-   bkl - Basisklassifikation-numbers
-   erj - year of publication

### Notes

-   queries can be combined with "and". The use of "and" is optional, though.
-   in many cases you can use the truncation sign "?"
-   spaces in person names are not supported - I am working on it. Please use the truncation sign ? after the first name for several given names. E.g. "per Maas,jan?"

### Sample queries

-   "marx kapital"
-   "per grodke and tit db2"
-   "per Maas,jan?"
